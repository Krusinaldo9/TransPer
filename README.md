# TransPer
An explainability framework for highlighting decision-relevant input data using layerwise relevance propagation.

# TransPer

Transper is a Python framework for explaining recommender decisions based on neural network decisions via the the Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP).

## Setup
* create virtual environment: `$ python3 -m venv venv`
* activate virtual environment: `$ source venv/bin/activate`
* install requirements: `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

For privacy reasons, the user data from the associated paper cannot be used. However, in Example.py we present a fictitious use case (see SampleModel.png) that explains the idea behind TransPer and facilitates an installation in a real-world scenario.
